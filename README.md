GA HW Finch Collector

## Resource
The resource I chose to use was NBA Basketball players. Within the application, users will be able to add their favorite players to their "roster" of favorite players. In addition to giving them accessories, such as headbands, shooting sleeves and more, to associate with those players. 

# Finch collector lab - Views and Templates

The lab for this lesson is repeating everything we just did, except you'll collect something else like Finches and call the project something like finchcollector, or whatever.

- Pick a resource. (Dogs, Cards, Stamps, etc)
- Initialize your project. (Do not forget your conda env)
- Create your db.
- Configure your application to connect to the db.
(Dont forget to use startapp to get your application folder and include it in your [settings.py](http://settings.py/))
- Create a home route, about route, and index route.
- Create a template view that extends a base for all the routes.

Because your completed Finch Collector app will be fairly comprehensive and be a nice addition to your portfolio, you should make it a repo in your personal GitHub account.
